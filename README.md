## Quickride

### Introduction

Quickride is a Telegram bot that brings the Uber expereince to Telegram via the Uber API.

### Goals

The main goal of this bot is to allow Telegram users to easily hail Uber cabs from the app directly.

Telegram is one of the largest messenger apps in the world, and it provides a robust bot API that allows one to easily make a feature-rich bot.

### Use cases and advantages

The bot is useful in situations such as:

- When a user has minimum mobile data available. (Telegram consumes the least amount of data. [[source](https://www.sostariffe.it/news/alternative-a-whatsapp-quanto-consumano-261505/)])
- When the user has limited storage space on the phone.

Telegram is also available on almost every popular platform, this allows one to hail Uber taxis from those platforms.

This bot also makes it faster and easier to hail a taxi due to its simple UX/UI, hence a less steeper learning curve.

### Structure

The bot can support several uses, with each users information stored and notifications sent separately.

**Flow**

1. User sets current position by either sending GPS coordinates from the phones location feature or by using inline mode and manully inputting a known location such as street name.

2. user selects the type of taxi. At the moment only "UberX" and the chapest alternative option is supported. However this may change.

3. User sets destination by either sending GPS coordinates from the phones location feature or by using inline mode and manully inputting a known location such as street name.

4. User receives notifications such as driver/car information, driving arriving status, receipt e.t.c.
